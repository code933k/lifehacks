= Stripped: =
Caches web comic strips creating organized collections

= Hashfm: =
(Recovered after an HDD crash / now useless ) 
Scrobbler I find useful and am willing to re-write in
spare time.

= asvm: =
A(n awk) Simple Volume Manager (I love this one)
There is a simple version called asvm.udisks which you
should use (after configuring udisks properly) for
single or multi _user_ environment.

Basically, automates disk/media mounting and it's
very useful on WM environments
(i.e., ratpoison, xmonad, dwm, wmii, etcetera).

The one from suckless isn't worth today and had some
problems in the past too.
