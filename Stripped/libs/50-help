OPERATION:

Execute: "stripped -l" to check the list of strips
available.  Pick some comics you like. Then,
execute: "stripped comic1 comic2 comic3", where
comic# is the name of the comics you want to get.

$HOME/Comics directory is created, and the comic
strips you picked are all cached there.

Then you can navigate through directories whose
name is the present date or just by strip name.

If a problem occurs, the program will try to tell
you whether it is a program BUG or some hint about
it.

For extended tips check, README.

CONFIGURATION:

Following freedesktop directives, configuration
files are created on:
- $HOME/.config/stripped/

An automated sanitizer checks that this dir is in
place with permission 0710 whenever the program is
executed.

Configuration files are: dir, funstrips, comics

- comics:
    File containing a space separated list of user
    preferred strips, example:
    dilbert xkcd nonsequitur

    If this file is not found. The program will
    download all the comic strips available.

- dir:
    This file contains the name of the local
    directory where retrieved strips should be
    stored. For example, ~/Pictures/ComicStrips

    If that is not found in the default directory, 
    The directory ~/Comics will be used by
    default.

- funstrips:
    This file contains user defined functions for
    strips retrieval. It does not need to be
    an executable.

    Be CAREFUL to make this correct as functions
    are ordinary shell ones, and their execution
    does not count on any protected mode as they
    are executed.

    User defined function override the program
    defaults.

    Example:

    strip_name() {
        URL='http://www.strip_homepage.net'
        NAME='Strip Name'
        ARTIST='Artist Name'
        PATTERN='grep POSIX regexp'
        MAINTAINER='youremail NO SPAM site.net'
    }

    See regexp 'man grep' if you need help
    understanding patterns. Or just look for
    examples on the files distributed with
    STRIPPED!
